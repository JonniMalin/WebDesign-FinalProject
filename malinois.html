      <h2>Shorter Hair Than the Others</h2>
      <p>The Malinois, which is often confused for a German Shepherd Dog, is actually smaller, leaner, and more slender than its cousin. It, like the other three varieties of Belgian Shepherd, is also recognizable by its square-shaped build, as opposed to the "slouch" sported by the German Shepherd breed. The Malinois is the variety of Dutch Shepherd most commonly used in police and military work. In fact, a Malinois named <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/no-ordinary-dog-true-story-dog-osama-bin-laden-mission/">Cairo</a> accompanied Seal Team 6 on the mission to eliminate Osama bin Laden.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Part of the reason I love the Malinois so much is that I had one myself, until recently. Her name was Layna, and I loved her dearly. She was as smart as the breed is lauded for being, and we could have entire interactions without a single word spoken because she was so attuned to my body language.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Here is some video of my Malinois, Layna, playing outside with me. Unfortunately, I turned the camera on a little late; she'd just got done with several laps around the field and was wanting to play fetch.</p>
