1. I learned a lot of new things in this class. I had *heard* of GitHub prior to taking this course, but had no idea what it actually was. I learned a lot about the site, learned that it has a desktop app (woah!), and learned how to use the site *and* the app. I also learned even more about html than I already knew (not that I already knew much to begin with) and reinforced what knowledge I had prior to this course. I don't think I'll ever forget how to use the <a></a> element again.

2. I think the biggest leap in my web design knowledge came from learning about CSS. I originally thought CSS was a coding language, like Java or Python, and I dreaded learning it because I'm definitely not cut out for coding. but it was surprisingly simple to learn. I still have a hard time with the whole "drawing with CSS" thing, but I'm slowly getting it.

3. I had a lot of challenges, but most of them came from outside sources. I feel as though I'd have been far more capable of learning this material if my home situation wasn't as... stressful as it is currently. Most of those problems couldn't be solved easily, but when it came to html and CSS, I solved most of my problems by taking notes, practicing concepts on the third-party pages provided in the course, and trying until I got things right.
